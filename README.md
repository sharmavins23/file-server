# File Server

This project is part of a collection of teaching projects intended for beginner,
intermediate, or even advanced programmers to learn and apply their skills.
These projects require little to no prior programming experience, but generate a
large amount of knowledge quickly.

This is a small file server written in Node JavaScript. The server is capable of
running as an HTTP server structure, through Express.JS as a middleware. The
project can serve files and be extremely flexible, and additional routes and
resources can be added with minimal coding effort or experience.

A full documentation on how one would go about creating, updating, or improving
this project (from near scratch!) is provided in the `/docs` folder. The index
of that folder also contains a summary of the individual portions.
