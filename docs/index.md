# File Server

This project is a basic framework for setting up a file server operating on the
HTTP standard. As it's on the HTTP standard, one can interact with this server
on any browser, or through any programming language supporting AJAX/HTTP
requests.

## Capabilities

The project gives a basic framework for file transfer, though it is relatively
vulnerable in terms of security. It's mainly meant for demonstrative purposes.

That being said, this server is still capable of some extremely strong things,
such as:

-   Serving _any_ file of any extension to any client;
-   Interacting with _any_ other program in the form of HTTP to send and receive
    data.

This functionality can be extended to any sort of form. For instance, the server
can be used to remotely control IoT devices, serve information to other programs
in a large format, and handle other networking.
